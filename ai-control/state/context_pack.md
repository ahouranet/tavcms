# Context Pack (خلاصه وضعیت پروژه)
- Versions pinned for bootstrap: Python 3.12.x, Django>=5.2,<5.3.
- Phase0-01 completed: Django monolith bootstrap created under `config/` + `apps/`.
- Settings split is in place: `config/settings/base.py`, `dev.py`, `prod.py`.
- `apps/core` exists as the shared-contract scaffold (no slug/dates logic yet).
- i18n groundwork enabled with `LocaleMiddleware` and `LANGUAGES` (`fa`, `en`).
- URL routing scaffold is language-prefixed via `i18n_patterns` with default language prefixed.
- Health endpoint scaffold exists for quick routing validation.
- README now includes bootstrap workflow (venv, install, migrate, runserver, createsuperuser).
- Current implementation uses SQLite for local bootstrap only; PostgreSQL setup is pending Phase0-03.
- No future-phase contracts (slug/dates implementation) were started in this task.
- Next task should focus on Phase0-02 from backlog ordering.
